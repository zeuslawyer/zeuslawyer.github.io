# WELCOME!

This is the main page where you can find the links that take you to my notes-to-self, and also some of [my favourite projects](/pages/my-projects), [my startup stuff](/pages/whooshka), and [my publications](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/zubin/). 

__Please note:__ These are living notes/documents and some are being written as you read them because I'm still learning every day on these subjects.  I will update them as I learn more, or realise I've made a conceptual error, or mistated something.   

 If you want to get in touch, especially to help me improve these notes,  hit me up on twitter [@zubinpratap](https://twitter.com/@zubinpratap) .

Cheerio!
