# WELCOME!

This is the main page where you can find the links that take you to my notes-to-self, and also some of my favourite projects. 

__Please note:__ These are living notes/documents and some are being written as you read them because I'm still learning every day on these subjects.  I will update them as I learn more, or realise I've made a conceptual error, or mistated something.   

 If you want to get in touch, especially to help me improve these notes,  hit me up on twitter @zubinpratap .

Cheerio!
